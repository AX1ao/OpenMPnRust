## âœ… Benchmark 1: Dot Product (OpenMP)

### Summary
- **Goal**: Compute the dot product of two large float arrays using OpenMP parallel reduction.
- **Size**: 100 million elements (N = 100_000_000)
- **Pattern**: Parallel map + reduction

### Observations
- The **dot product values increase** as thread count increases â€” this is expected due to more samples being processed before rounding losses.  
  > ðŸ’¡ OpenMPâ€™s `reduction` clause doesnâ€™t guarantee exact summation order, so results may vary slightly â€” **totally fine**!
  
- The **time values decrease steadily** up to 16â€“32 threads, and **start plateauing** around 32â€“64 â€”  
  > ðŸ§ª This reflects **perfect real-world scaling behavior** with expected overhead kicking in at high thread counts.
